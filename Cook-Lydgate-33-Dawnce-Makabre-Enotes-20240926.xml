        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/cook-lydgate/blob/main/cook-lydgate-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

    <text><body xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><anchor xml:id="Cook-Lydgate-33-Dawnce-Makabre-Enotes"/><div type="text">
 <note type="enote" n="1">1<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">O ye al whilk that by me cummes</hi><hi rend="italic"> and gothe</hi>. This poem presents itself as an epitaph or memorial inscription, addressing itself to passersby. For more on the ‘speaking’ tombstone, see the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">notes to lines 76</ref> and <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">78</ref> below.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">8–14<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Why art thou . . . has sone pasayge</hi>. This second stanza touches on each of the seven deadly sins: pride (“prowde elacyon”), avarice (“wordly covetyse”), anger (“wrathe”), envy (“invyos swellyng”), gluttony (“glotony”), sloth (“Brynnyng in slomer and slawly in corayge”), and lust (“to be lycheros”).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">22 <space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Salomon . . . with al his prudence</hi>. Solomon is the Old Testament Israelite king known for his wisdom and traditionally considered the author of the biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">23<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">myghty Sampson duk </hi><hi rend="italic">invyncybyll</hi>. In the Old Testament Book of Judges 13–16, Samson is a leader of the Israelites who possesses extraordinary physical strength. His strength failed after his long hair was cut by his mistress Delilah, in violation of his Nazarite vow.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Tullyus the retrysciane with al his eloquence</hi>. Marcus Tullius Cicero, (106 BCE–42 BCE), is a Roman politician and rhetorician whose letters were an important stylistic model for medieval writers.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">25<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Arystotil</hi>. Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) is considered one of the founders of the Western philosophical tradition.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">26<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Or this emprour Octavy mest pessybyll</hi>. Gaius Octavius Augustus is the first Roman emperor, grandnephew of Julius Caesar. His reign (27 BCE–14 CE) coincided with a period of relative peace known as the <hi rend="italic">pax romana</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">22–27<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Wher is Salomon . . . </hi><hi rend="italic">Jonathas ful amyabyll</hi>. This 6line stanza with an <hi rend="italic">ababbb</hi> rhyme scheme breaks from the poem’s regular 7-line <hi rend="italic">ababbcc</hi> stanza form. This stanza is an example of the <hi rend="italic">ubi sunt</hi> (where are they?) trope, which reflects on the greatness of departed figures from the past. See also the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 141–44</ref> in “Three Messengers of Death” (DIMEV 5387) in this edition.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">27<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">swete Jonathas </hi><hi rend="italic">ful amyabyll</hi>. Jonathan is considered a model of loyalty, whose friendship with King David is described in 1 Kings 18.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">30<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">twynkillyng of ane ee</hi>. Proverbial. See Whiting T547.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">38<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">As Job says in his funerall obsequye</hi>. The protagonist of the biblical book of Job is considered a model of devout and patient suffering; see also the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 3</ref> in “Three Messengers of Death” (DIMEV 5387) above. The more specific reference here may be to <hi rend="italic">Pety Job</hi>, a popular poetic meditation on the Office of the Dead, written in the midfifteenth century. <hi rend="italic">Pety Job</hi> quotes from and imaginatively expands upon a series of verses drawn from Job’s speeches, as well as material from the Book of Psalms. As “The Dawnse of Makabre” (DIMEV 4104) says, the purpose of <hi rend="italic">Pety </hi><hi rend="italic">Job</hi> is that readers “may lerne to dye.” The “tretys” mentioned in line 40 refers to the biblical Book of Job.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">42–43<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">O erthly man . . . sal to erth</hi>. An allusion to Genesis 3:19: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.” This theme also reappears in line 58. See also Whiting E22.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">51<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Into powdyr we </hi><hi rend="italic">sal fall</hi>. The phrase evokes the Order for the Burial of the Dead in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer (“I Commende thy soule to God the father almightie, and thy bodye to the grounde, earth to earth, asshes to asshes, duste to dust, in sure and certayne hope of resurreccion to eternall lyfe, through our Lorde Iesus Christe” sig. T6v; STC 16272) which itself alludes to Genesis 18:27: “And Abraham answered, and said: ‘Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes.’”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">63<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Man remembyr of the dawnce of makabre</hi>. This is the only explicit reference to the <hi rend="italic">danse macabre</hi> in the poem. The injunction for the reader to remember echoes line 18 of the A version of Lydgate’s <hi rend="italic">Dance</hi><hi rend="italic"> of Death</hi>, which suggests that readers imprint the <hi rend="italic">Dance</hi> in their “memorial” or memory.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">76<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">ite venite</hi>. Literally, “go, come” (e.g., come from here), this Latin phrase was a common inscription on tombstones. The phrase evokes the address to those who “by me cummes and gothe” in the first line of the poem.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">78<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">this litterall scripture</hi>. A pun. The poem is literally inscribed on the tombstone.</note>
 </div></body></text></TEI>
